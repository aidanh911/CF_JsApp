This was a project focused on using different technologies and synthesizing them into an application. 
the main focuses were implementing an API, and integrating a modal that takes information based on the api, 
I used a little bit of jquery, but the other portion was integrating bootstrap.

some of the problems I faced was learning where to define the columns for the bootstrap grid, and also, and formatting some of the elements in general was difficult.
also hooking the modal up to the api, and learning how to retrieve specific elements in the right format provided some challenge.
