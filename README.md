In this project I created an application where a user can interact with a pokedex of 200 pokemon, where by clicking on the chosen pokemon they can see a brief description and image.
I faced some issues converting the api details to a recognizable format for later code. 
If I could go back I would get more familiar with github, so that I could make more dynamic changes in the code without worrying about losing progress.
This project helped familiarize me with independent learning because some of the intricacies of bootstrap I had to delve into the documentation to get an understanding of how to implement them in my specific project.

The project used HTML, CSS, Javasctipt, Bootstrap, Eslint and Prettier.
